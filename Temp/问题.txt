1.if the speed is too fast, it will through the wall
2.a better friction 
3.angular friction
6.Edge collide
7.edge vs polygon is not so correct
8.ridgidbody with rod behave not correct

solved:
1.A ball fall down to ground, if the ball'speed is close to zero, it will
 	snowly go through the ground.
2.run a fixed time, core dumped: The new Manifold() is not good because we 
	assume we have two rigidbody for all the method in Manifold class
3.rod's len will change: use correct pos
4.sleep: Check force and velocity
